# Roll-a-Ball: Time-Limited Coin Quest

In "Roll-a-Ball", players navigate a sphere across different terrains with one goal in mind: collect all the golden coins before time runs out. The game is divided into three levels:

- Easy: Ideal for beginners. A straightforward grid layout with coins placed in clear sight.

- Medium: With an uptick in ball speed and a hastier timer, players need to be quick on their reflexes.

- Hard: The ultimate test. With the ball's maximum speed and an unforgiving countdown, only the best will triumph.

*Stay within bounds, avoid pitfalls, and race against time in this thrilling ball-rolling adventure!*
